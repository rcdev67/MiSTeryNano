# MiSTeryNano

The MiSTeryNano is a port of the
[MiSTery Atari STE FPGA core](https://github.com/gyurco/MiSTery) to the
[Tang series of FPGA boards](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/index.html)
like the [Tang Nano 20k FPGA board](https://wiki.sipeed.com/nano20k). Recently support
for the [Efinix T20](https://www.efinixinc.com/shop/t20.php) has been added.

MiSTeryNano implements the hardware of an [Atari ST](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) allowing it to
run the original operating systems as well as the majority of games and
productivity software of the [Atari ST](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST).

## This fork (branch `nano20k-running`, Tang Nano 20K)

This fork is what runs on my Tang Nano 20K with the onboard BL616 and the
[FPGA-Companion fork](https://github.com/rcdev67/FPGA-Companion) (branch
`net-download`). The two belong together. What it adds to upstream:

- **Floppy drive sounds**: spindle and head movement from real samples,
  gated on actual disk activity, volume in the OSD.
- **Timing constraints** for the flash, SDRAM and MCU SPI interfaces, and
  a flash path sampled on the falling edge; build scripts `build_p2r1.tcl`
  and friends with the placement and routing options the tested bitstreams
  were made with.
- **External serial port on the M0S connector** (pins 41/51), selectable in
  the OSD as `Serial: Ext. UART`: the ST talks to a real modem there, for
  example an ESP32 running
  [Zimodem](https://github.com/rcdev67/Zimodem/releases).
- **A second port for the companion on the same pins** (`Serial: Netz`):
  the companion uses the modem itself to load files from a PC onto the SD
  card, chosen in the OSD. 255-byte FIFOs, up to 460800 baud, the data
  interrupt is a level so nothing can get stuck in the FIFO.
- **SD card**: the companion can read and write sectors without holding the
  SPI bus, a busy card after a write is waited for (up to four seconds),
  a write error ends the command instead of hanging the controller.
- **Disk change**: the floppy controller reports write protect for half a
  second after an image is mounted, so TOS notices the change and re-reads
  the boot sector; before, a double sided image inserted after a single
  sided one showed an empty directory until a reset.

Everything upstream still works as before; the additions are off until
selected in the OSD. Details are in the commit messages.

A complete MiSTeryNano setup also requires a supporting MCU acting as
the [FPGA Companion](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/FPGA-Companion/).

## Getting started

In order to use the MiSTeryNano the following things are needed:

  * Tang FPGA board like e.g. the [Tang Nano 20k](https://wiki.sipeed.com/nano20k) to run the MiSTeryNano core itself
  * MCU board like the [M0S Dock](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixzero/m0s/m0s.html) to run the [FPGA Companion](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/FPGA-Companion/) to connect USB keyboard and mouse
  * Breadboard to wire everything up and some jumper wires, or
  * [a MiSTeryShield](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/Boards/tree/main/misteryshield20k/)
  * a USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect regular USB devices to the M0S Dock

Many other variants can be built using various Tang FPGA boards and different MCUs.

## Installation on e.g. Tang Nano 20k

The installation of MiSTeryNano on the Tang Nano 20k using can be done
using a [Linux PC](INSTALLATION_LINUX.md) or a [Windows PC](INSTALLATION_WINDOWS.md).

See the [trouble shooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you run into problems.

## Wiring

The properly flashed Tang Nano 20K will boot into the Atari ST desktop
even without anything else connected. But in order to use the system
you need at least a keyboard and most likely also a mouse. These are
usually connected through the M0S Dock.

Additional connections exist for a physical DB9 joystick or
Atari ST mouse and MIDI IN and OUT. The usage of these pins
is optional. They can just be left unconnected. A joystick may
then be connected via USB instead.

## Usage

The MiSTeryNano is mainly controlled through an on-screen-display (OSD)
overlaying the main Atari ST screen. The OSD is opened using the F12
key. It can then be used to select floppy and harddisk images and to
configure the running system.
